    <span><p>Katamari Damacy is a third-person action/puzzle game where you roll a magical, sticky ball (the katamari) around different environments, picking up anything smaller than it. 
      As the katamari grows, so do your rolling possibilities- from snacks, office supplies, animals, entire crowds, and ultimately, islands of the world. 
      Every level has a size goal and a time limit, simply grow big enough and fast enough, or fail and be scolded by the King of all Cosmos. (note 1)</p></span>

    <span><p>The story starts when the giant King of All Cosmos accidentally wipes out the stars, moon, and much of the universe. 
      To fix his mistake, he sends his tiny son, the Prince, on a mission to Earth to roll up katamari to recreate the stars in the night sky. 
      As the game progresses, the tasks escalate in scale and surprise, reflecting the King’s overconfidence and the growing mess of the situation.

    <p>By the final levels, the katamari becomes massive, capable of absorbing entire environments. 
      The Prince successfully recreates the stars and constellations, restoring the universe. 
      The King is satisfied, though he never really takes responsibility, leaving the ending pretty funny and lighthearted.

    <div>What makes Katamari Damacy so fun is how it constantly forces you to adapt. 
      All of your movement, planning, and awareness has to change every time the katamari grows, echoing Ernest H. Lindley’s idea that puzzles stay engaging through mental adjustment rather than repetition (note 2). 
      At the same time, the game’s fixation on tiny, ordinary details, snacks, toys, furniture, gives it a strange sense of texture, something Roland Barthes describes as the “reality effect.” It’s silly, colorful, and chaotic, but that’s exactly why it 'sticks' with you. (note 3)
